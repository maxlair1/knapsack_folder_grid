## Build a Folder Grid in React + TypeScript

### üß≠ Overview

This challenge is focused on building a responsive Folder Grid interface in React using TypeScript. It's designed to evaluate your skills in component architecture, styling, interaction design, and system-level thinking.

You'll be working in a preconfigured CodeSandbox environment that includes folder data and an icon system. Your task is to design and implement a reusable FolderGrid UI.
